## [Unreleased]

---

## [v1.6.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Mutual TLS 1.3 on QUIC (client certificate flight).** When `ClientConfig.client_cert_path` and
  `client_key_path` are both non-empty, the client sends `Certificate` + `CertificateVerify` + `Finished`
  after the server flight. The server verifies the client `CertificateVerify` and optional `Finished`-only
  clients remain supported.
- **`transport.io.serverConnPeerLeafCertificateDer`** — read the captured client leaf DER from a server
  `ConnState` after handshake completion when mutual TLS was used.

### Changed

- **`ServerHandshake.processClientHandshakeInbound`** replaces Finished-only handling in the QUIC server
  CRYPTO path (`handleHandshakeCrypto`).
- **Client handshake tail retransmit** may send multiple Handshake packets (chunked CRYPTO) when the
  mutual TLS payload exceeds one datagram.

---

## [v1.6.2] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`Client.peerLeafCertificateDer()`** — exposes the server's leaf
  certificate as DER bytes after handshake completion (PR #122).
  Embedders (e.g. a Zig libp2p PeerId derivation layer) can read the
  raw cert without re-parsing the TLS handshake. Lifetime is the
  client's; copy if you need it past `deinit`.

### Changed

- **TLS client leaf-cert capture.** `ClientHandshake.processServerFlight`
  now parses the first DER-encoded certificate from the TLS 1.3
  `Certificate` handshake message and stores up to 16 KiB on the client
  state. Existing handshake behaviour is unchanged.

---

## [v1.6.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **Raw application STREAM reassembly.** Embedders using
  `raw_application_streams = true` previously dropped any STREAM frame that
  arrived ahead of the current contiguous offset (logged as `raw app gap`),
  losing data on UDP reordering. The receive path now buffers out-of-order
  chunks and splices them in once the preceding bytes arrive, matching the
  in-order reassembly the HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/3 code paths already had.
  Affects both server and client.

### Changed

- **`Client.flushDeferredAck` is now `pub`.** External event loops that drive
  the client via `feedPacket` (instead of the built-in `run` loop) must call
  `flushDeferredAck` once per inbound-drain cycle so the peer receives ACKs
  and keeps sending application data. Backwards-compatible: the built-in
  `run` loop already invokes it internally.

---

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **Minimum Zig version: 0.15.0 → 0.16.0.** zig 0.16 reorganised most of
  `std`: `std.net`, much of `std.fs`, the high-level socket helpers in
  `std.posix`, `std.crypto.random`, and `std.time.milliTimestamp` were
  removed or relocated behind the new `std.Io` abstraction. zquic owns
  its own UDP event loop and does not need `std.Io`'s async machinery,
  so this release introduces `src/compat.zig` — a thin shim that
  reinstates the pre-0.16 surface (Address, fs.File, socket / bind /
  sendto / recvfrom / close, getAddressList, milliTimestamp, an
  OS-CSPRNG-backed `std.Random`) by dispatching directly to the platform
  syscall layer.
- **Pure-Zig restored.** `compat.zig` calls `std.os.linux.*` raw
  syscalls on Linux; the build links no libc on Linux, so
  `zig-out/bin/server` is a statically-linked ELF with zero C
  dependencies. Apple targets (macOS / iOS / tvOS / watchOS / visionOS)
  link Apple's `libSystem` because Darwin does not expose a stable
  syscall ABI — every other QUIC implementation does the same. The Zig
  source contains no third-party C dependencies on either platform.
- **Pure-Zig DNS resolver.** `getAddressList` parses IP literals first,
  then `/etc/hosts`, falling through to `getaddrinfo` only on Darwin.
  Linux without libc never calls libc DNS code.
- **`std.process.argsAlloc` → `std.process.Args.Iterator`.**
  `cmd/server` and `cmd/client` now take `std.process.Init.Minimal`.
- **`std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator` → `std.heap.DebugAllocator`.**
- **`X25519.KeyPair.generate()`** (now requires an `Io` instance) is
  replaced by `generateDeterministic(seed)` seeded from the compat
  CSPRNG.

### Fixed

- **Vendored `tls.zig` lifetime errors.** Four
  "returning address of expired local variable" failures in
  `vendor/tls/src/transcript.zig` (`pskBinder`,
  `serverFinishedTls13`, `clientFinishedTls13`, and the standalone
  `pskBinder_` helper) — now back the slices with scratch buffers on
  the inner Self struct.
- **`mmsghdr_const` alias removed in 0.16.** `transport/batch_io.zig`
  uses `mmsghdr` for both send and recv paths (identical layout).

### Limitations

- **`benchmarks/throughput_bench.zig` is stubbed** until
  `std.process.Child` (now Io-driven) is migrated. The bench-e2e CI
  step still runs (and exits 0) so the build chain stays green.
- **Vendored TLS** `Bundle.fromFilePath*` and `key_log.fileWrite` are
  stubbed out (`error.UnsupportedOnZig016`) — zquic does not consume
  them. Re-enable when porting to `std.Io.Dir`.
- **DPLPMTUD probing** still TODO (pre-existing).

### Tests

- 165/165 unit tests pass.
- 13/13 quic-interop-runner tests pass on the Linux pure-Zig build.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Security

- **Retry token replay window closed (#108):** tokens now embed a minting
  timestamp and are rejected after 30 s. The `retry_secret` rotates hourly;
  the previous secret is kept for one TTL so tokens minted just before
  rotation remain valid. Bounds the blast radius of a leaked secret from
  "forever" to ~1 hour + 30 s.
- **Retry token format** extended from 53 to 61 bytes (adds 8-byte timestamp
  into the HMAC-SHA256 input).

### Fixed

- **FINAL_SIZE_ERROR enforcement (#109, RFC 9000 §3.5/§11.3):** per-connection
  tracker cross-checks RESET_STREAM `final_size` against any prior STREAM+FIN
  final size on the same stream, and vice-versa. Mismatch triggers
  `FINAL_SIZE_ERROR` (0x06) rather than silent acceptance.
- **Non-minimal varint rejection (#110, RFC 9000 §16 MUST):** `varint.decode`
  now rejects varints encoded in more bytes than needed. Prevents peers from
  bloating packets and restores canonicalization.
- **Active connection ID limit (#111, RFC 9000 §5.1.1):** client tracks the
  count of unretired CIDs received from the peer and drops packets that would
  exceed the advertised `active_connection_id_limit` (default 2 per §18.2).
- **ACK range underflow (#112, RFC 9000 §19.3):** `LossDetector.onAck` now
  returns `error.FrameEncodingError` when `first_ack_range > largest_acked`,
  and `AckFrame.parse` validates every additional gap/range for underflow.
  Previously saturating subtraction silently accepted malformed ACKs.
- **Stream-initiator violations (#113, RFC 9000 §19.8):** reject STREAM frames
  that write to send-only unidirectional streams (server rejects sid_type 3,
  client rejects sid_type 2). Bidirectional streams continue to accept frames
  in either direction.
- **Coalesced packet parser hardening (#115):** replaced raw `@intCast` of
  varint-decoded lengths with `varint.lenToUsize` for defense-in-depth.

### Changed

- **`varint.DecodeError`** adds `NonMinimalEncoding`.
- **`LossDetector.onAck`** now returns `OnAckError!OnAckResult` (breaking API
  vs 1.4.x).
- **`AckFrame.parse`** returns `(varint.DecodeError || error{FrameEncodingError})!…`.

### Documentation

- Prominently calls out that `MAX_CONNECTIONS = 16` on the demo `Server`
  struct is not a protocol cap; production embedders use `initFromSocket` +
  `feedPacket` with their own heap-allocated connection map (#114).

### Tests

- 165/165 unit tests pass (added 6 new tests: 5 varint boundary cases + 1 ACK
  underflow). 13/13 quic-interop-runner tests pass.

---

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`transport/path_mtu.zig`:** clamp configured max UDP payload (RFC 9000 §14.1)
  and derive per-connection `app_stream_chunk` for HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/3 sends.
- **`ServerConfig` / `ClientConfig`:** optional `max_udp_payload`; **`ConnState`**
  fields `max_udp_payload` and `app_stream_chunk`.
- **`zquic.transport.path_mtu`** export in `root.zig`.

### Changed

- **`stream_manager.zig`:** explicit stream state transitions; **`onRecvReset`**
  and **`StreamManager.onResetStreamFrame`** for RESET_STREAM final-size rules.

### Fixed

- **HTTP/3 (`io.zig`):** use a comptime-sized buffer for DATA frame encoding so
  **ReleaseSafe** builds succeed (`conn.app_stream_chunk` is runtime-sized).

### Documentation

- README: configurable path MTU via `max_udp_payload`; DPLPMTUD probing still out
  of scope.

---

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Security

- **Timing-safe comparisons** for Retry HMAC verification, stateless reset token
  tails, and TLS Finished `verify_data` (`std.crypto.timing_safe.eql`).

### Changed

- **Peer stream limits (RFC 9000 §4.6):** track `peer_max_bidi_streams` /
  `peer_max_uni_streams`, apply incoming **MAX_STREAMS** frames on client and
  server, and enforce limits when allocating local stream IDs.
- **`rawAllocateNextLocalBidiStream` / `rawAllocateNextLocalUniStream`** now
  return `!u64` and **`error.StreamLimitExceeded`** when the peer’s limit is
  reached (breaking API vs 1.2.x).
- **Varint lengths:** `varint.lenToUsize` rejects values that do not fit in
  `usize`; STREAM, CRYPTO, NEW_TOKEN, and CONNECTION_CLOSE parsers use it.
- **Transport parameters:** `buildClientTransportParams` propagates varint
  encode errors instead of `catch unreachable`.
- **Constants:** single `types.max_datagram_size`, QUIC version literals via
  `types.Version`, shared TLS transport-params extension id, file-level
  `MAX_FIN_RETRANSMITS`.
- **Verbose I/O:** `std.log.scoped(.zquic)` instead of `std.debug.print` when
  verbose mode is enabled.

### Fixed

- **Streams (`stream_manager.zig`):** reject inconsistent FIN final sizes; ignore
  `closeLocal` when already closed or after `reset_sent`.
- **Version Negotiation `build`:** reject DCID/SCID lengths above 20 bytes.

### Documentation

- README: Path MTU discovery not implemented; embedder notes for `try`
  `rawAllocate*`.

---

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Security

- **Connection IDs and random material**: generate CIDs, stateless reset tokens,
  and PATH_CHALLENGE bytes with `std.crypto.random` instead of a millisecond-seeded
  PRNG (avoids collisions when multiple packets are handled in the same ms).

### Changed

- **QUIC-TLS transport parameters**: encode varints via `varint.encode` (remove
  duplicate local encoder).
- **Retry integrity verification**: always compute the expected tag before
  comparing; use `std.crypto.timing_safe.eql` for the 16-byte MAC.

### Documentation

- README “Implementation notes” (version negotiation, demo `Endpoint`, CSPRNG).
- Clarify demo `Endpoint` connection limit, `retry_token` buffer, version
  negotiation helpers, and `CachedAes128Context` design tradeoff.

---

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **`Client.startHandshake`**: send the Initial (ClientHello) when using an external UDP
  recv loop (`feedPacket` / `processPendingWork`) instead of `Client.run()`.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Custom ALPN**: `ServerConfig.alpn` / `ClientConfig.alpn` and helpers
  `serverTlsAlpn` / `clientTlsAlpn` for non-HTTP TLS handshakes
- **Raw application streams**: when `raw_application_streams` is enabled on both
  sides, inbound STREAM data is stored in `RawAppStreamSlot` buffers without
  HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/3 parsing
- **Embedder I/O**: `feedPacket` / `processPendingWork`, `initFromSocket` with
  optional socket ownership, local stream ID allocation, `sendRawStreamData` for
  1-RTT STREAM frames, and receive buffer views for raw streams
- **README**: Embedder guide section (consolidated from the former `docs/EMBEDDER.md`)

---

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Performance

- **Cached AES-128 key schedules**: pre-expand AES round keys in `KeyMaterial`,
  eliminating per-packet key schedule computation for both AEAD and header
  protection — ~36% throughput improvement on small transfers
- **Batch UDP receive**: use `recvmmsg` on Linux to receive up to 64 packets per
  syscall, reducing kernel transitions
- **Eliminated buffer copies**: build 1-RTT packets directly in the send buffer
  instead of copying through an intermediate buffer
- **Tuned congestion MSS**: raise maximum segment size from 1200 to 1350 bytes,
  increasing payload efficiency while staying within the 1500-byte Ethernet MTU

### Fixed

- **Uninitialized AES contexts**: cached AES contexts are now properly initialized
  in all key derivation paths (handshake, application, key update, session
  resumption, 0-RTT) — fixes resumption, http3, zerortt, connectionmigration,
  and multiplexing interop tests
- **IP fragmentation on NS3 links**: reduce H09/H3 chunk sizes to 1350 bytes so
  total IP packets (UDP payload + 28-byte IP/UDP headers) stay within the
  1500-byte MTU — fixes ecn and rebind-port interop tests
- **Hard-coded chunk sizes in retransmit paths**: H3 retransmit and path migration
  code now uses the module-level chunk constants instead of stale literals

### Interop

- All 13/13 quic-interop-runner test cases passing

---

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

#### Protocol coverage
- **RFC 9000** — QUIC transport: connection establishment, packet processing,
  stream multiplexing, flow control, connection migration, path validation
- **RFC 9001** — QUIC-TLS: Initial/Handshake/1-RTT encryption, header protection,
  key updates (client-initiated and server-initiated), session tickets, 0-RTT
- **RFC 9002** — Loss detection and congestion control: New Reno (cwnd, ssthresh,
  slow start / congestion avoidance / recovery states), RTT estimation (SRTT,
  RTTVAR, PTO), packet-threshold loss detection — all wired into the event loop
- **RFC 9114** — HTTP/3: framing (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, GOAWAY, PUSH_PROMISE,
  CANCEL_PUSH, MAX_PUSH_ID), control streams, trailing HEADERS, GOAWAY on shutdown
- **RFC 9204** — QPACK: static table, dynamic table insertions, encoder/decoder
  streams, Section Acknowledgements, blocked streams
- **RFC 9369** — QUIC v2: initial secrets, packet type bits, Retry integrity tag

#### Frame handling
- RESET_STREAM (0x04) and STOP_SENDING (0x05) — stream cancellation
- CONNECTION_CLOSE (0x1c/0x1d) with draining period (3 × PTO, RFC 9000 §10.2.2)
- RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID (0x19) — CID lifecycle management with fresh CID issuance
- STREAMS_BLOCKED (0x16/0x17) — responds with MAX_STREAMS
- MAX_DATA, MAX_STREAM_DATA, DATA_BLOCKED, STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED — flow control
- PATH_CHALLENGE / PATH_RESPONSE — path validation and connection migration
- NEW_CONNECTION_ID — alternative CIDs for migration
- ECN (ACK-ECN frames, ECT(0) marking on all outgoing packets)

#### Infrastructure
- Idle timeout: connections idle for >30 s are silently closed (RFC 9000 §10.1)
- Congestion controller and RTT estimator reset on path migration (RFC 9002 §9.4)
- Release CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on `v*` tags:
  runs tests + fmt check, builds linux/amd64 binaries, creates GitHub Release
- QLog writer for structured connection traces
- Stateless Reset token generation and detection

#### Interop
- All 13 QUIC interop runner test cases passing:
  `handshake`, `transfer`, `retry`, `chacha20`, `keyupdate`, `v2`, `ecn`,
  `resumption`, `http3`, `zerortt`, `connectionmigration`, `multiplexing`,
  `rebind-port`

### Known limitations
- 0-RTT anti-replay: no server-side nonce cache (safe for idempotent file serving;
  see issue #75 for the roadmap item)
- Connection-level stream limits are advertised but not enforced on the receive side
